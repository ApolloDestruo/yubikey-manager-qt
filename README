=== Features
This application provides an easy way to perform the most common configuration tasks on a YubiKey.

The current version can:

This tool can configure a [Yubico OTP](https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/) secret, a static password, a challenge-response credential or an [OATH](https://developers.yubico.com/OATH/) HOTP credential in both of these slots.
* Swap the functionality between two configured YubiKey Slots
* Enable or disable the different USB connections.
